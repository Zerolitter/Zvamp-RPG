# Changelog

- added custom trait icon package support through `ServerExtTraitIcons.upk`
- moved perk stat cost tuning into `KFSkillcosts.ini` with global stats, perk groups, grouped class additions, and `A1`/`B1` front-panel stat groups
- added `KFZvampCustomItems.ini` support and `ZRefreshnewitems` for custom trader item refreshes
- added compatibility config helpers for knife, syringe, and camera behavior through `KFZvampKnife.ini`, `KFZvampSyringe.ini`, and `KFZvampCamera.ini`
- added server-backed admin tools and short console commands for testing and live management, including `admin f`, `admin endwave`, `god`, and `diag`
